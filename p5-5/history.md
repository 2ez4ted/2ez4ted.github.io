  working on Blackjack.

Beta Test result:
  The game had few functional errors as I was expecting. The entire game has its mainframe set up, but
  I dont think its yet close to finish.
  1) add asset system and relevant calculation to it.
  2) add tutorial video link
  3) add visual representation better than few white rectangles and numbers
  4) hide buttons when appropriate.
  5) the burnDeck() function and discard() function cannot parse correctly.
  6) have to add something else to it like giving ace a value of 11 when appropriate.
  7) maybe change the background to a picture?
  8) make sure the presentation include things to explain, such as key rules and potential features.
