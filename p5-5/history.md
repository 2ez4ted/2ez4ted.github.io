BlackJack for 1

milestone:
  Dec 22, 2018, finished need to Have
  Dec 25, 2018, came up with the basic logic
  Dec 29, 2018, rewrote the need to Have and nice to Have

  Between Dec 22 and Jan 7, I was working on some Trap Adventure game but failed to continue due to multiple factors. Then I restarted
  working on Blackjack.

  Jan 3, 2019, put down some sketches
  Jan 6, 2019, replaced default p5 shuffle function with Fischer-Yates shuffle
  Jan 11, 2019, finished composing the basic functions (and some stem codes of the functioning part)
  Jan 17, 2019, finished visualizing the game.
  Jan 17, 2019, ran beta test with my uncle
  Jan 19, 2019, removed previous discard function and replaced it with new discard(someArray)
  Jan 21, 2019, finished expressing ACE card in both value === 1 and value === 11.

Beta Test result:
  The game had few functional errors as I was expecting. The entire game has its mainframe set up, but
  I dont think its yet close to finish.
  1) add asset system and relevant calculation to it.
  2) add tutorial video link
  3) add visual representation better than few white rectangles and numbers
  4) hide buttons when appropriate.
  5) the burnDeck() function and discard() function cannot parse correctly.
  6) have to add something else to it like giving ace a value of 11 when appropriate.
  7) maybe change the background to a picture?
  8) make sure the presentation include things to explain, such as key rules and potential features.
